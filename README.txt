job-tools - Client/server tools to distribute multiple jobs
===========================================================

These tools allow you to easily distribute a large number of small tasks over
several worker processes. The job server hands out a list of lines, each
describing some job, to a number of clients who handle these jobs.

See the file [INSTALL.txt](INSTALL.txt) for building and installation
instructions.
